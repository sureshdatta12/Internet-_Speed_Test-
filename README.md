# Internet _Speed_Test 
This is a Python-based GUI application to test your internet speed using the `speedtest-cli` library and `tkinter` for the GUI.

 ## Software Requirements:
 1) Python: You need Python installed on your system (version 3.x).

2) Libraries:
   tkinter: This is a standard Python library for GUI applications, included with Python's standard distribution.
   
   speedtest: This library needs to be installed separately using pip.
   
          To install speedtest:
          pip install speedtest-cli

## Hardware Requirements:
1) Operating System: Compatible with Windows, macOS, or Linux.
2) RAM: At least 2GB of RAM is sufficient for running this simple GUI application.
3) Processor: Any modern CPU should be sufficient to run Python and perform the speed test.


## How To Run:
1) Install Python:

   Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system.
   You can download Python from the official Python website.
   
       visit https://www.python.org/
   Follow the installation instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
   Verify the installation by opening a terminal (or command prompt) and typing:
   
       python --version
2) Install Required Python Libraries:

   Open a terminal or command prompt.
   Install the speedtest-cli library using pip by typing:
   
       pip install speedtest-cli
   tkinter is usually included with Python's standard library. If it's not installed, you can use the following command to install it:
   For Ubuntu/Linux
   
       sudo apt-get install python3-tk
   For Mac or Windows, it is included with the Python installation.
   
3) Download or Create the Python Script:

   create a new Python file named internet_speed_test.py using a text editor (such as Notepad, Visual Studio Code, or PyCharm).
   Copy and paste the provided code into the file.

4) Run the Python Script:

   Open a terminal or command prompt.
   Navigate to the directory where internet_speed_test.py is saved using the cd command. For example:

       cd path/to/your/directory
   Replace path/to/your/directory with the actual path where your Python script is saved.
   Run the script by typing: 
  
       python internet_speed_test.py
   This will open a new window displaying the Internet Speed Test application.
   
 5) Use the Application:

    In the application window, you will see a "Check Speed" button.
    Click the "Check Speed" button to start testing your internet speed.
    The application will display your Download and Upload speeds in Mbps.
